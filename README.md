USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle maps are the gold standard of detailed topgraphic maps in the United States.  These maps cover the entire country, in swatches of roughly 40 square miles per map.  Quad maps are made available free of charge by the USGS, but the browsing and downloading interface is not very quick or mobile-friendly, and the state of Montana alone is divided into over 3,000 separate maps.  For these reasons, it is difficult both to pinpoint and to obtain the specific quad map that covers any given location.

This quad map locator tool is intended to make it quick and easy to find and download quad maps on a mobile phone, and to load them into Avenza for offline viewing, waypointing, and route tracking.  The primary intended use case is wildland firefighting operations, especially initial attack.  

Bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome.  I am hoping soon to release another version that also fetches and displays direct links to the U.S. Forest Service's FSTopo maps, which are an excellent alternative to USGS quads. (FSTopo maps are more detailed and far smaller in filesize, but lack the optional shaded relief layer; they are available only for quadrangles containing national forest land.)
