USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle maps are the gold standard of detailed topgraphic maps in the United States.  These maps cover the entire United States, in swatches of roughly 40 square miles per map.  Quad maps are made available free of charge by the USGS, but the browsing and downloading interface is not very quick or mobile-friendly, and the state of Montana alone is divided into over 3,000 separate maps.  For these reasons, it is difficult both to pinpoint and to obtain the specific quad map that covers any given location.

This quad map locator tool is intended to make it quick and easy to find and download quad maps on a mobile phone, and to load them into Avenza for offline viewing, waypointing, and route tracking.  The primary intended use case is wildland firefighting operations, especially initial attack.  Please post all feedback and error reports on the github repository (https://github.com/oskvig/USGS-quad-map-locator).
